# You are working at a lower league football stadium and you've
# been tasked with automating the scoreboard.
# The referee will shout out the score, you have already
# set up the voice recognition module which turns the ref's
# voice into a string, but the spoken score needs to
# be converted into a pair for the scoreboard!
# e.g. "The score is four nil" should return [4,0]
# Either teams score has a range of 0-9, and the ref
# won't say the same string every time e.g.
